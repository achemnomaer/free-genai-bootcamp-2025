# Sentence Constructor: Claude

## Overview

This project creates a chat agent using Claude that helps beginners translate English sentences into Japanese. The agent provides guidance and feedback without giving direct answers, targeting JLPT5 level learners.

## Files

- **prompt.md**: Instructions for the Claude agent, including role and teaching guidelines.
- **examples.xml**: Sample interactions showing expected responses and behavior.

## How to Use

1. **Configure**: Adjust `prompt.md` to refine the Claude agent's behavior.
2. **Test**: Use `examples.xml` to evaluate the agent's responses for clarity and accuracy.

## Model Performance

In testing, Claude 3 Sonnet was used, showing strong capabilities in providing structured guidance and maintaining consistency in Japanese language instruction.
